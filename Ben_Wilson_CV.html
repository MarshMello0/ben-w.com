                    I am a gameplay programmer located in the south of United Kingdom who loves making core mechanics
                    and the polishing them off step by step. I enjoy the metal challenge and the satisfaction after a
                    week getting something finally working.

                            <p>
                                Block Factory is a sandbox factory builder where you are tasked to build an efficient
                                factory to
                                sell and earn as much money as you can. You will have a base set of blocks such as auto
                                crafter and
                                pipes to create something to sell, then, later on, you will be able to research and use
                                better and
                                more efficient blocks and create better and more complicated items to sell to earn more
                                money. As
                                Block Factory was created by me only I had to do all of the assets and the code by
                                myself, I used
                                Unity 2017 and MagicaVoxel.

                                with controller support. Infected 2D was also created as a solo project meaning all the
                                assets and
                                code was done by myself, the software I used was Photoshop and Unity 5.

                        Games Development 2016 - 2017</a></h2>

                In Games development level 2 we learnt the basics of programming, art with such programs as Construct 2
                and Photoshop. The course had split into 4 different assignments and at the end of each assignment we
                had to print off all of our research, ideas generation and final work except the final assignment where
                the whole college switched over to making wordpress sites instead. You can view mine at <a href="https://gamesdevelopmentblogweb.wordpress.com/">https://gamesdevelopmentblogweb.wordpress.com/</a>

                        2017 - 2019</a> </h2>

                Level 3 was very similar at Northbrook, except there was now modeling and programming was C# instead of
                visual style in Construct, the software we learnt in that year was Maya, Unity, Adobe Illustrator. The
                work was in the same style of 8 Units grouped together and it was all uploaded to my wordpress site at
                <a href="https://benlevel3.wordpress.com/">https://benlevel3.wordpress.com/</a> .
