                        I am a gameplay programmer located in South-east England. I enjoy working with the core
                        mechanics of a variety of mediums
                        and am passionate about implementing them step by step. I enjoy the mental challenge and the
                        satisfaction after completing a complex project.
                        My current personal project at the moment involves Virtual Reality and networking.

                            <p>
                                Polluted is my current main focus for college, this is for the final major project of my
                                last year in my course at GBMC. The theme this project is Forgotten, from that I have
                                gather researched based around the word, thought of four different possible game ideas,
                                written a proposal for the chosen idea, done more detailed research for that chosen
                                idea, created some prototypes to see how it would work and currently on the final
                                production of the game. For this last project we have more weeks compared to my other
                                projects but still have to create all of the art and code my self, the software I am
                                using for Polluted is Blender for the modeling, Unity for the game engine and Visual
                                Studio for writing the code. You can view my development log <a

                            <p>
                                Battleships is a small prototype I made for an assignment in my second year of level 3
                                at GBMC. This project I had to create a game based around the theme Nautical,
                                Battleships was a multiplayer boat game where the goal was to skin the most amount of
                                ships before you get sunk. As this was part of my college assignment I had to create all
                                of the art and code my self, the software I used was Unity and Photoshop and for the
                                networking, I used ForgeNetworking Remastered. You can view my development log <a

                            <p>
                                Block Factory was a college project for my final major project where we were tasked in
                                creating a game based around the chosen theme. That year the theme was Revolution. I
                                started with gathering research around the word revolution and thinking of different
                                possible ideas for a game that I could create, then once I had picked one idea I went
                                into more detail with research-based around that idea. Once I had collected enough
                                research I created a simple prototype to make sure the core mechanics felt and played
                                well before I went onto creating all of the assets and writing the code for the game.
                                The game engine I used was Unity 2017 and MagicaVoxel for the art and we had three weeks
                                of final development which can be read through on my development log <a

                                Infected 2D was my first game ever I completed and released in my spare time. The main
                                reason for creating Infected 2D was it learn more about Unity so I could use it for my
                                level 2 final major project instead of Construct 2. It took me 7 weeks to finish it off
                                and all of the art and code was done by me in Unity 5.4.1f1 and Photoshop and the music
                                was from <a href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music" target="_Blank">Ben

                                Gold Heaven was a side project I did with some others which I met in a discord server, I
                                joined their team under the name TeamBlueApps where we create this idle game for the
                                google play store. I was the main coder and there were another coder and one artist. We
                                used Unity's collab system which made it easier for us to work on the project at the
                                same time, as I was the main coder I did all of the core features whereas the owner, the
                                other coder, just implementing the art, and designing the user interface. I used Unity
                                and Visual Studio for this project.

                        Games Development 2016 - 2017</a></h2>

                In Games development level 2 we learnt the basics of programming, art with such programs as Construct 2
                and Photoshop. The course had split into 4 different assignments and at the end of each assignment we
                had to print off all of our research, ideas generation and final work except the final assignment where
                the whole college switched over to making wordpress sites instead. You can view mine at <a

                Level 3 was very similar at Northbrook, except there was now modelling and programming was C# instead of
                the visual style in Construct, the software we learnt in that year was Maya, Unity, Adobe Illustrator.
                The
                work was in the same style of 8 Units grouped together and it was all uploaded to my WordPress site at
                <a href="https://benlevel3.wordpress.com/">https://benlevel3.wordpress.com/</a> . I also continued on to
                the extended diploma at GBMC (Northbrook College). In the second year, we experiment a bit with the
                Unreal Engine and the Blueprint system. You can view my last years' blog at <a
