                My name is Ben Wilson and I am a Junior C# programmer.<br>
                I am currently studying Games Development at
                Northbrook College
                to become a gameplay programmer. In the two years I have been at college studying, I have created
                and finished 4 games, 3 of them I have released and gained a small following on <a

                                            UConsole is a simple free in-game console which you can add to your Unity
                                            Projects to help you debug and test out custom commands during development.
                                            <br>
                                            UConsole was heavily inspired by the console which is in Unreal Engine 4, I
                                            felt that people could have a use for this in the projects as well in games
                                            built in the Unity Engine. All it is is one prefab which you just have to
                                            drag into your scene then it starts to work. It relies on TextMeshPro's text
                                            to display clear and customizable text in the console window, it was created
                                            on Unity 2018.3 with the new prefab system.

                                            Presence) on discord.
                                            UERP was my first ever attempt at trying to make a plugin for the editor,
                                            but it wasn't my first time with the Discord Rich Presence API so I had
                                            already understood how to use the discord API (apart from timestamps) but I
                                            still had a lot to learn about coding in the editor. You can read up about
                                            it in my two blog posts. <a

                                            was created for my final unit in my first year in Level 3 Games Development
                                            at Northbrook, where we were set a theme of revolution then got given 3
                                            weeks to create a game. All my assets were created in MagiaVoxel and the
                                            game was created in Unity. This was a hard project from the logical sides of
                                            things, mainly getting the pipes to work with the items flowing long them
                                            was a big challenge, I had to make sure the pipes checked if a new pipe had
                                            been placed on an open side and tell the information to items which were
                                            going through, but still making it optimised when there were large amounts
                                            of pipes placed.

                                            This was my first ever completed project in Unity C# back in 2017, I had a
                                            clear understanding of what the logic behind it should be, but I didn't know
                                            what code I had to write. My main big help during the creation of the game
                                            was Unity's documentation, once I understood how to read that and use the
                                            information from that in my way, it accelerated the process of making it. My
                                            only other source of support was forum posts when searching up a problem, I
                                            am happy that I didn't follow any tutorials to create this as it set a good

                                            Gold Heaven was my first team project for TeamBlueApps which consisted of
                                            two programmers and one artist. This group was formed together by a post on
                                            a Unity Community Discord server, I was the main coder because I had a lot
                                            more experience compared to the owner. This was my first ever Unity project
                                            for mobile and I did enjoy creating it apart of a team, however, when we had
                                            it on the Play Store and was thinking what to work on next I left the team
                                            to work on other projects.

                                            created in my first ever year in Level 2 Games Development at Northbrook, it
                                            was for the final assignment where I took the plunge and switched to Unity
                                            from learning Construct 2 the whole year. I was working on this for college
                                            while creating Infected 2D at the same time at home, both to learn how to
                                            use Unity and code in C#.

                            This prototype was my first tests at creating a VR game. The idea was to recreate the
                            physics gun from Garry's Mod. If you haven't played Garry's Mod, the physics gun is a
                            weapon which has the power to pick up and move items at the end of its ray. In this
                            prototype, I used a primitive cube as the weapon, which could be held and thrown in any
                            hand.
                            When you press the trigger a small straight laser would show up at the end of the weapon
                            and you
                            could pick up items if they had a certain script on them. As you can see in the video,
                            items
                            aren't fixed at the end of the ray, which is similar to the ray in
                            Garry's Mod. However, I couldn't manage to make a ray render, so I had to stick to my
                            straight line laser. This prototype just took a day to create and used the SteamVr Plugin
                            for Unity and the primitive cubes for the assets.

                            Battleships is a multiplayer top-down pirate game where your goal is to sink the most amount
                            of ships without getting sunk by other players. This was done as apart of a college
                            assignment where I documented the whole process of development <a
                                href="https://benlevel3year2.wordpress.com/project-management-dev-log/"

                                12</a>. The goal of this
                            prototype was just to learn more about network programming in Unity, things I had to think
                            about during planning, how to overcome problems and good ways to write network code. I did
                            learn a lot from creating this, even though there are lots of problems with the code, I have
                            noticed them and understand that there are now other ways to achieve the same thing. Just
                            had to get my first messy attempt at networking out of the way and start learning. <br>
                            Battleships was created in Unity 2018.2.14 using Forge Networking Remastered and Photoshop
                            for the graphics.

                            I have also done some modeling inside and outside of class. Here are a few of the models I
                            have created. The sci-fi barrel was created and textured inside of Substance Painter in
                            class, then I created the laser sight in the top left in my spare time, the magazine was
                            a quick thing I did one day where I just modeled something simple and applied a basic
                            material in Substance Painter to make it look a bit better. Lastly I created the Gatling
                            gun from
                            Space Engineers.

                                        Raft is a survival game based out at sea, where you have to try and survive
                                        alone or with your friends and expand your raft while exploring islands
                                        along the way. I first started modding as soon as I bought the game, as
                                        Raft was creating in Unity it was quite easy for me to start modding and
                                        adding new things. However I have stopped playing Raft but still support
                                        people modding over in the <a href="https://discord.gg/raft"

                                        but in the course of my time modding raft I created three mods which can
